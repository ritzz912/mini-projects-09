            <h4>Is YouTube Social Media?.</h4>
            <i class="icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>Yes! Just think about the comments sections, community posts and YouTube Live chat boxes. Though the main content is created by one user, hundreds, thousands or millions of people interact around content and content creators. The combination of media with a social aspect makes it (you guessed it) social media.</p>

        <div class="answer">
            <p>The first step is getting 500 subscribers to your channel (the “community” of the Community tab) or enabling access to advanced features on your channel. You can enable advanced features, or find out if you are eligible to do so, through the “Channel” tab of YouTube Studio settings. You can also view your Community tab settings through Studio settings.</p>

            <h4>What Are the Benefits of YouTube for Businesses?</h4>
            <i class="icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>YouTube is the second-most visited website in the world, with more than 1.7 billion unique users hopping on each month. Therefore, the platform generates lots of traffic to your video content, channel and website. To most users, video is more engaging than other content, and it is in high demand.

                Videos that rank high in YouTube search results are also more likely to rank in the Google video carousel, which is another opportunity for your brand to gain exposure in the SERP. Even if you do not have a lot of resources for high-production-value content, using YouTube for business promotion offers plenty of advantages as a platform.</p>

            <i class="icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>In the sense of specific accounts, no. However, you can get demographic information about your viewers from the Audience tab in YouTube Analytics. Get information like which videos have pulled in the most new users, age and gender breakdowns and geographic locations for your userbase.</p>
